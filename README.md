# TOSTER_Addins
Small functions I wrote to add to the TOSTER package functionality. 

eqtable(): Function to create ggplot-friendly tables from multiple TOST objects
eqplot(): Plots eqtable output or creates table first in case of multiple objects. Calls eqtable()

Adding Soon: 
eqprint(): Prints the relevant data of the EQ test in APA Format, incl. options for RMarkdown-friendly output.
